CREATING CONTROLLERS FOR THE DOMAIN OBJECTS

1) create controller for Car
  a) grails create-controller com.careworkstech.carworks.Car
  b) scaffold it just to show how that works and how quickly a CRUD app can be stood up
    i) static scaffold = true
    ii) scaffolding is a plugin as of grails 2.3
    iii) scaffolding isn't typically done for production apps since it is so simplistic
  c) grails run-app and play around with the UI and make some car records
    i) they'll get cleared upon app restart anyway
  d) seems you can't... because there are no Models yet

2) create controller for Model and scaffold it
  a) grails create-scaffold-controller com.careworkstech.carworks.Model
  b) it automatically added static scaffold = true

3) create controller for Make and scaffold it
  a) grails create-scaffold-controller com.careworkstech.carworks.Make

4) create controller for Trim as well
  a) grails create-scaffold-controller com.careworkstech.carworks.Trim

5) delete the generated Spec files for now (we'll come back to those later)

6) check out the scaffolded controllers and use them to make some data
  a) go to the MakeController and create a Make - 'Chevrolet'
  b) go to the ModelController and create A Model - 'Corvette'
    i) notice that the Make select is showing "com...Make:1" instead of "Chevrolet"
    ii) we need to create a toString method to make these less awful
    iii)

    String toString () {
        name
    }

7) go over groovy's method signatures (def vs type) and return statements
 
8) add toString methods to other domain classes real quick (Make, Model, Trim, Car)
  a) for Car can get fancy
    String toString () {
      model.make.toString() + ' ' + model.toString() + ' ' + trim.toString() + ' ' + id.toString()
    }
  b) if you do, might want to make it avoid NPEs by adding question marks (shorthand null checks)
    model?.make?.toString()

9) also when creating a Car, notice that mileage is required but there's no default
  a) give it a default in the domain class
  b) Integer mileage = 0

10) if DataSource keeps disappearing then you might want to change from 'create-drop' to 'create'

THAT IS GOOD FOR SNAPSHOT 2
(NEXT WE WILL LOOK AT CONFIGURATION AND BOOTSTRAPPING DATA)
